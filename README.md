# Advanced_Numerical_Methods

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RossMeikleham/Advanced_Numerical_Methods.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RossMeikleham/Advanced_Numerical_Methods)

Work for my Mathematics Master's course in Advanced Numerical Methods.
The class is focused on implementing methods in MATLAB, I'm also adding implementations
in C++ with OpenMP to parallelize some of the algorithms.
